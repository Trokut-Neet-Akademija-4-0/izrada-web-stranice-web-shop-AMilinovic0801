                    First thing to look for when buying car from Japanese auctions is an auction card, which contains information about the car. The auction card is being prepared by a Japanese estimator working for an auction house, carefully checking the car and describing it. Here are included information such as: VIN number, mileage check, car rating (1 to 5, 5 is the highest rating) interior rating (from E-A, where A is the highest rating), color coat state and mechanical state of the car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The buying process starts with finding the car the customer wants. In case the car meets the customer’s requirements, payment of the deposit ( which depends on vehicle) is needed before proceeding with inspection of the vehicle. After deposit is payed, we contact our agent in Japan. He personally checks the car on the spot before the auction, further emphasizing the good and bad side the vehicle can have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reviewing and verifying the status of the vehicle (agent’s opinion + the added photos or videos), the buyer makes the purchase decision.

                    The buyer offers the amount he is willing to pay for the vehicle before the auction. If bidding stops before your maximum offer, you will buy a vehicle at the price at which bidding stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a successful auction, the buyer pays the bill for a car, which includes the car price, auction house fee, transportation to the Japanese port, cargo to Europe and its insurance. Car transport from Japan to Europe usually lasts about 2 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further fees, such as 10% EU customs duty and 19% VAT (in Germany), will be payed after the vehicle arrives at the port of destination.
                    After customs clearance, the car is transported to our headquarters where it can be taken over by the buyer or can be delivered to any address.
