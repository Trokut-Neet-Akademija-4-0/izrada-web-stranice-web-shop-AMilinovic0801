            <h3>Liberty Walk Ferrari F40</h3>

                    The prolific Japanese customizer Liberty Walk's latest creation is a wildly modified Ferrari F40. The dramatically lowered and widened supercar will undoubtedly be considered heresy for Ferrari purists, but the car is undeniably staggering. Liberty Walk has been customizing cars for decades, and each year the base cars get increasingly outrageous. It was all good and fun when founder Wataru Kato was slicing up modern Nissan GT-Rs and Lamborghini Murcielagos. No one really shed a tear about the numerous Mustangs, BMWs, or 360 and F430 Ferraris. The Mitsuoka Orochi was actually an improvement. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the Ferrari F40 is a bona fide classic. It's one of the most beloved cars on the planet and it's rare too, with just a hair over 1,300 ever to roll out of Maranello. And no, this isn't some kind of kit car trickery like when they displayed a jaw-dropping Lamborghini Miura at the Tokyo Auto Salon, later revealed to be a reskinned Ford GT40 replica. Kato has had a white Ferrari F40 kicking around his garage for at least a decade plus.

                    With nothing more that could top past builds, it seemed that the F40's time had come. The kit comes with a new nose section that stays true to the original intake pattern but as you move aft aggressive ducting and vents begin to resemble the race-modified F40 LM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A slammed airbag suspension and an array of canards, diffusers, and a modified wing add to the list of changes. Topping it all off are a set of exposed fastener fenders stuck to the rear haunches. The surgery is irreversible too, with parts of the F40's original kevlar and carbon fiber body sacrificed for the installation. Watch this Hagerty video for more details on the build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kit is something you can actually buy on the Liberty Walk website, for some of the 1,300 or so F40 owners who would like to do this to their own car. No price is listed; one must call to inquire, and it won't be as cheap or easy as buying stick-on portholes for your V6 Chrysler 300 at Pep Boys. 

                    Most Ferrari owners would probably rather take a hacksaw to their own limbs than cut up an F40, so it'll be a truly niche market. However, there are probably enough F40s in climate controlled garages that one or two modified ones isn't a big deal. In fact, there are likely more F40s left in pristine condition than Nissan NX2000s or first-gen Chrysler Town & Countrys.

                    The Mazda RX-7 FC stands proudly among the most underrated JDM cars. It was history-changing for Mazda as an auto manufacturer when it was first introduced in 1984, as it had the first turbocharged twin-rotor engine. Its sharp aerodynamic design adopted from the FB RX-7 and Mazda Cosmo captured the hearts and enthusiasts. No car in its class could come close to what the RX-7 offered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today the RX-7 FC is a popular choice among first-time JDM car buyers despite the troubles that rotary engines can bring to their pockets. Live a little, they say. Furthermore, the maintenance costs don’t hurt as much since you can quickly get one for a few thousand dollars. If an RX-7 FC has been on your mind, we have composed this buying guide for you comprising of the pros and cons of buying one, issues to expect, and what you should look for when buying a Mazda RX-7 FC.

                    The buyer offers the amount he is willing to pay for the vehicle before the auction. If bidding stops before your maximum offer, you will buy a vehicle at the price at which bidding stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a successful auction, the buyer pays the bill for a car, which includes the car price, auction house fee, transportation to the Japanese port, cargo to Europe and its insurance. Car transport from Japan to Europe usually lasts about 2 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further fees, such as 10% EU customs duty and 19% VAT (in Germany), will be payed after the vehicle arrives at the port of destination.
                    After customs clearance, the car is transported to our headquarters where it can be taken over by the buyer or can be delivered to any address.

            <h3>Nissan Skyline R34/R35</h3>

                    Nissan unveiled the GT-R in 2007, five years after discontinuing the R34 GT-R. During those five years, there were rumors that we’d never see another Skyline. Toyota fans also feared they might never have another Supra after the MK4, which was discontinued around the same time as the R34 GT-R. All there was to hope for were renders by car enthusiasts depicting what the replacements would look like. But does the GT-R live up to the Godzilla name first bestowed upon the Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When first tested at the Nürburgring, the Nissan GT-R was faster than the Porsche 911 997 Turbo. This is despite the GT-R costing as half as much and being heavier. The initial power output from the twin-turbocharged VR38DETT was 475 horsepower. Not much to consider a supercar, but it does the job even though Nissan gradually increased horsepower figures to 485 in 2009, 523 in 2010, and up to 600 in the 2024 GT-R NISMO.
                </p>

            <article class="faq_right">
                <p>
                    Power is sent to all wheels via a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission which disappointed fans since they expected a manual transmission option. When Nissan unveiled the 2024 GT-R, fans were even more disappointed since Toyota introduced a 6-speed manual transmission option for the Toyota Supra A90 (MK5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it’s not the power output or the transmission that makes the GT-R unequal to most supercars in its class. Its functional design comprising extreme aerodynamics and steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber construction ensures it’s well planted to the ground without compromising airflow. Ever seen a GT-R launch? It almost has no wheel slip, even on a non-prepped surface! In his review, Jeremy Clarkson said, “Certainly, you should never use the launch control in this car unless you brace your head against the headrest at the time. Because if you’re not, the whiplash could put you in hospital.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The electronically adjustable double-wishbone front suspension and independent multi-link rear suspension with stabilizers ensure a smooth driving experience and excellent handling. Modern driver aids such as EBD (Electronic Brake Distribution), electronic traction control, and Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC-R) make the Nissan GT-R one of the best-handling sports cars.

            <h3>What kind of car is the "K-car" unique to Japan?</h3>
            <img class="last_img" src="../web-shop/images/other/k-car.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="content_container wow fadeInUp infinite">

                <p>
                    Currently, the K-car standard is that the body size is 3.4 m or less in total length / 1.48 m or less in total width / 2.0 m or less in total height, the displacement of the engine is 660 cc or less, and the maximum capacity is 4 people.
                    It is much more compact than a compact car with a total length of 4.7 m or less and a total width of 1.7 m or less.
                    In addition, it has many advantages such as low economic burden, good fuel economy, maintenance costs such as taxes, and low highway tolls.
                    The history of K-car in Japan began in 1949 when the K-car standards were first established.
                    The K-car standard at the time of its enactment was much smaller than it is now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1950, the standard for three-wheeled and four-wheeled K-car was 3 m or less in length, 1.3 m or less in width, 2.0 m or less in height, and a displacement of 300 cc.
                    After that, in 1954, the body size remained the same, and the displacement was set to 360cc or less regardless of the engine model.
                    At the same time, the "National Car Concept" set up by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (now the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) supported the development of K-car.                    
                    The famous car "SUBARU 360" that debuted in 1958 was born based on this regulation.
                    After that, MAZDA R360, SUZUKI Fronte, MITSUBISHI Minica, etc. were released.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq_right">
                <p>
                    After that, the standard was repeatedly revised and expanded, and in 1998 it became the current K-car standard.
                    Today, there are various body types such as wagon, sedan, SUV, convertible, truck, and van types.                    
                    Among the wagon types, the Super Height Wagon, which has a total height of more than 1.7 m, has a large interior space and a sliding door, and is popular with the child-rearing generation.                    
                    There are HONDA N-Box, DAIHATSU Tanto, SUZUKI Spacia, etc., and some models are equipped with electric sliding doors on both sides.                    
                    Other wagon types have a total height of 1.7 m or less, but have sufficient interior space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5-door vehicles such as SUZUKI WAGONR, HONDA N-WGN, and NISSAN DAYZ are common.
                    The sedan type is not tall, but the weight of the car is lighter and it can be used as a daily foot.                    
                    SUZUKI ALTO, DAIHATSU Mira, HONDA N-ONE, etc. are popular.                    
                    Open cars include DAIHATSU COPEN and HONDA S660.                    
                    COPEN is the smallest mass-market in the world and is a K-car equipped with an electric roof of a car.                    
                    For engines, there are NA type and more powerful turbo (supercharger).                    
                    In addition, as for safety equipment, the number of models equipped with advanced safety equipment of the same level as ordinary vehicles and also equipped with a false start suppression function is increasing.
